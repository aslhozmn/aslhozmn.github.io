          <p>In June 2013, I started my undergraduate program at Hacettepe University, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I bypassed preparatory class and earned my bachelor degree in June 2017. I make constant effort to improve myself in my career and socially.
          <br><br>
          I have the ability to quickly understand, assimilate and implement programming languages. I am interested in the fields of Computer Programming, Embedded Systems, Operating Systems and Signal Processing. During my undergraduate studies, I took courses related to these topics which I am motivated to work on. For my graduation project, I worked on both hardware and software developments in the study titled "Distant Temperature Measurement for Detecting Sleep Apnea Episodes" conducted by Prof. Dr. Atila YILMAZ and Res. Asist. Tuna ORHANLI. After graduation, I have been accepted for and started my MS program at Hacettepe University, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. While pursuing my MS degree, I have had 3 months of work experience in the field of System Engineering. During my work experience, I have found an opportunity to work under the System Engineering department and experienced all steps of project cycle from System Engineering perspective. Also, I have had detailed knowledge about System testing and integration processes.
          <br><br>
          I build good relationships with people and am in harmony with social groups. I am sure that I can be a member of team works and also can manage and follow project processes and groups. I am confident that I will be able to carry out the necessary research on my field of study and assigned tasks in a perfect way.

            The half-wave rectifier chopped off half our signal. A full-wave rectifier does more clever trick: it flips the - half of the signal up into the + range. When used in a power supply, the full-wave rectifier allows us to convert almost all the incoming AC power to DC. The full-wave rectifier is also the heart of the circuitry that allows sensors to attach to the RCX in either polarity.<br>
            A full-wave rectifier uses a diode bridge, made of four diodes.<br>
            The thing to realize is that the diodes work in pairs. As the voltage of the signal flips back and forth, the diodes shepard the current to always flow in the same direction for the output.<br>
            So, if we feed our AC signal into a full wave rectifier, we'll see both halves of the wave above 0 Volts. Since the signal passes through two diodes, the voltage out will be lower by two diode drops, or 1.2 Volts.<br>
            If we're interested in using the full-wave rectifier as a DC power supply, we'll add a smoothing capacitor to the output of the diode bridge.<br>
            A full wave rectifier circuit wasdesigned and the circuit was turned into a printed board circuit." rel="prettyPhoto">

During the project, I had designed a two different FM Demodulator – Band Bass Filter Circuitries which are the part of
Analog Remote Controlled Car Project. The purpose of these BPF circuitries is to demodulate incoming signal to conclude
which frequency are applied from the command. According to demodulated incoming signal frequency, the car is turning to
the right or to the left. BPF circuitries were designed, Simulations and PCB designs of circuitries were done by using Proteus
and required components were soldered on to PCB.
At the end, required tests were made to control if the two different BPF circuitries works properly or not." rel="prettyPhoto">

to design and simulate an analog communication system operating on noisy channel and observing the effect of channel
noise on different modulation types.
During the project MATLAB was used for design and simulation of the system. An analog modulator is designed to
produce different types of modulated signal such as Amplitude, Frequency, Double Side Band, Double Side Band Suppressed
Carrier and Single Side Band modulation. After Randomly additive white Gaussian noise generated and applied to the
modulated signal. At the same time, Analog demodulator such as Coherent, Envelope detector and Phase Locked Loop is
designed to demodulate noisy signal to reproduce message signal.
At the end, all modulation types are applied to the sample sound signal. After message signal is observed by applying
proper demodulation type and effect of channel noise is analyzed.

Device which was demanded by a Language School.
I have played a role in all stages of this project from requirement analysis and determination phase to the prototype
production phase. The main purpose of this device was to give user a translated English – Turkish text in 3 different levels. This
different level texts can be chosen via analog buttons and also touch screen. Selected level texts given user via thermal printer.
Translated texts can be updated remotely. Also, on the standby mode desired advertisement can be demonstrated via touch
screen.
We have used and learned the following hardware and software components to implement the device. Also, we have
used Proteus to design circuitry of the System and make PCB design.
 Raspberry Pi 3 and GPIOs
 Touch Screen
 Thermal Printer (UART)
 SIM 900 GSM/GPS Module (UART)
 FT 232 USB to UART Board

detecting short term pauses lasting minimum 10 seconds in breathing or decreased breath volume while sleeping. Sleep apnea is
a leading cause of excessive daytime sleepiness and lack of concentration along with occasionally triggered cardiac events. The
standard method to diagnose sleep apnea problem is to use polysomnography (PSG) device in sleep rooms of hospitals. This
clinical routine is expensive and difficult since there are long queues to be waited for proper examination and requires attendance
by an expert along with the patient to operate the system. It is also reported that the patients find this routine useless. Most of
the time due to massive cable connections that cause uncomfortable conditions for deep sleep.
The main purpose of this project is to detect the temperature variations observed from the mouth region of the head
from the certain distance instead of using standard electrodes and other cables to record physiological signals which are useful
for apnea diagnosis. The device that developed is able to monitor and process breathing activities indirectly around the mouth by
using non-contact temperature measurement sensors which are directed to mouth. Then, processing the signals obtained by
these sensors and detecting sleep apnea episodes.
For this purpose, we designed a prototype system at the end of the project. This system consist of 5 Thermal Sensor and
a Microcontroller. While sleeping, Thermal sensors were located around the human face by overlapping their field of views and
creating a sleeping circle (gantry). By the way, even if the person changes position while sleeping, the system can continue to track
sleeping activity.
OMRON D6T-44L-06 Thermal sensor was used to record breathing temperature signals. Communication of Thermal
sensor with Arduino Leonardo microcontroller done by using 𝐼2𝐶 Communication protocol. Received temperature signals are
recorded and visualized via Java simultaneously on PC. After, Recorded signals were evaluated and developed Sleep Apnea
detection algorithm applied by using MATLAB to conclude whether sleep apnea event occurred or not." rel="prettyPhoto">
